  ## Description 
    
  
  This is an easy way to generate ReadMe files for projects, hopfully saving time on the creation process by staying in the VS Code application. It uses JavaScript to generate markdown based on preloaded questions that are given. Results will be shown in an "ExampleREADME" file that will be auto generated. This program will not overwrite your main README file. 
  
This ReadMe was created with this generator.

  ## Installation
  
    
  You will need to have NODE installed on your PC/laptop first. In your CLI, you will need to install NPM and then install Inquirer from the NPM package. Once those are installed, you will be able to use the terminal inside of VS Code to run the program.
